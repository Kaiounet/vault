# Fleeting - Initial Note

## Quick Capture
I think using Zettelkastan method in Obsidian is the go to when managing your knowledge.

## Context
- I got this idea from reading the article [A Beginner’s Guide to the Zettelkasten Method](https://zenkit.com/en/blog/a-beginners-guide-to-the-zettelkasten-method/).
- It does matter because I want to learn how to learn and structure my gained knowledge.

## Next Steps
- [ ] Process into permanent note
- [ ] Find related notes
- [ ] Add to literature note (if from source)
